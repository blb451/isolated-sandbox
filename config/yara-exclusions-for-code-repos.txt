# YARA Rule Exclusions for Code Repository ZIP Scanning
# Minimal exclusions to reduce false positives while maintaining security
#
# ⚠️  WORK IN PROGRESS: This exclusion list is still being tuned based on
# real-world testing with various code repositories. If you encounter false
# positives or false negatives, please report them so we can adjust the ruleset.

# EXCLUDE: Generic base64 detection (too common in legitimate code)
possible_includes_base64_packed_functions
contains_base64

# EXCLUDE: Large number patterns (common in crypto implementations and test data)
Big_Numbers3

# KEEP ALL OF THESE - Still important for security:
# - Base64_Encoded_Executable (specific executable patterns)
# - UPX_Packer, ASPack, VMProtect, Themida (actual malware packers)
# - All trojan/backdoor/RAT specific rules
# - All ransomware rules
# - All keylogger rules
# - All specific malware family rules
# - Suspicious PE header anomalies
# - Known exploit signatures

# Note: We're only excluding the most generic rules that trigger on
# normal code patterns. Real malware will still be caught by:
# 1. ClamAV signatures
# 2. Specific malware family YARA rules
# 3. Behavioral patterns unique to malware
# 4. Known exploit signatures
